   - [ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE] Now a doubly-linked list. Nodes can be traversed from start to end or from end to start.
   To use the doubly-linked list functions (like reverse-traversal), #include the doubly_linked_list.h file in the Source.cpp file.
   - Added function to print list in reverse (Due to the previous pointer)
   - Fixes and improvements

   - Made crash prone (user is now bound to give correct input as per input type selected)
   - Added an object of type Input and a function void input(Generic, char) in nested class LinkedList of templated Generic class Node in doubly_linked_list.h file
   - std::cin replaced with function input() at several locations in doubly_linked_list.h file
